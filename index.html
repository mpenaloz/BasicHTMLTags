    <h2>After that, we have some random words about chocolate</h2>

    <hr />

    <p>So in all fairness, chocolate is good, but I have an issue with the chocolate we eat. I would much rather have pure cacao than the sugar infested chocolate that we normally eat</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>For Example:</h3>
    <hr />

    <ul>
        <li>Cacao is healther</li>
        <li>The taste is more natural</li>
        <li>The recipies it's used in are generally better tasting</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>I rest my case</h3>
